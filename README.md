# Weather-API

This repository contains the code for my Weather API project, demonstrating my skills and experiences in web development. The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface for accessing weather information. It includes features such as real-time weather updates, location search functionality, and interactive visualization of weather data. Whether you're a weather enthusiast or a developer looking to integrate weather information into your applications, feel free to explore the code and customize it to suit your needs!
